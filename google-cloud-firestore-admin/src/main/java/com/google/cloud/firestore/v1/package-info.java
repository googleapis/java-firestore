/**
 * A client to Cloud Firestore API
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= FirestoreAdminClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
 *
 * <p>This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
 *
 * <p>Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are used as defined
 * in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
 *
 * <p>Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
 *
 * <p>The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
 *
 * <p>Index creation is performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is created for each such
 * asynchronous operation. The state of the operation (including any errors encountered) may be
 * queried via the Operation resource.
 *
 * <p>The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the specified Project
 * (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not created directly but through calls on
 * other collections or resources.
 *
 * <p>An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as part of the
 * Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after 30 days. By default, ListOperations
 * will only return in progress and failed operations. To list completed operation, issue a
 * ListOperations request with the filter `done: true`.
 *
 * <p>Operations are created by service `FirestoreAdmin`, but are accessed via service
 * `google.longrunning.Operations`.
 *
 * <p>Sample for FirestoreAdminClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (FirestoreAdminClient firestoreAdminClient = FirestoreAdminClient.create()) {
 *   IndexName name = IndexName.of("[PROJECT]", "[DATABASE]", "[COLLECTION]", "[INDEX]");
 *   Index response = firestoreAdminClient.getIndex(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
