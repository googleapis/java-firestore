    api_description: is a fully-managed NoSQL document database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.  It's backed by a multi-region replicated database that ensures once data is committed, it's durable even in the face of unexpected disasters. Not only that, but despite being a distributed database, it's also strongly consistent and offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform products, including Google Cloud Functions.
