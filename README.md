About Google Cloud Firestore
----------------------------

Cloud Firestore is a fully-managed NoSQL document database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.  It's backed by a multi-region replicated database that ensures once data is committed, it's durable even in the face of unexpected disasters. Not only that, but despite being a distributed database, it's also strongly consistent and offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform products, including Google Cloud Functions.

Troubleshooting
---------------

To get help, follow the instructions in the [shared Troubleshooting document](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-common/blob/master/troubleshooting/readme.md#troubleshooting).

Transport
---------
Firestore uses gRPC for the transport layer.

Java Versions
-------------

Java 7 or above is required for using this client.
